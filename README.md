# Installation

## Installing to IRIDA

Please download the provided `irida-plugin-mlst-[version].jar` from the [releases][] page and copy to your `/etc/irida/plugins` directory.  Now you may start IRIDA and you should see the pipeline appear in your list of pipelines.

*Note:* This plugin requires you to be running IRIDA version >= `19.01`. Please see the [IRIDA][] documentation for more details.

## Installing Galaxy Dependencies

In order to use this pipeline, you will also have to install the [mentalist][], and [combine_tabular_collection][] Galaxy tools within your Galaxy instance. These can be found at:

| Name                         | Version  | Galaxy Tool                                                                         |
|------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| mentalist                    | `0.1.9`  | <https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/dfornika/mentalist/a6cd59f35832>               |
| combine_tabular_collection   | `0.1`    | <https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/nml/combine_tabular_collection/b815081988b5>   |

### Replacing the Automatically-Installed Conda Environment

MentaLiST is implemented in the Julia programming language. Due to some complications with the way that Julia has been packaged into the conda ecosystem, it is likely that the automatically-created conda environment that Galaxy creates for MentaLiST will be broken upon initial installation.

The IRIDA project has defined a conda environment file that can be used to create a replacement conda environment that is known to work.

To replace the automatically-installed conda environment:

# Usage

## Monitoring Pipeline Status

To monitor the status of the launched pipeline, please select the **Analyses > Your Analyses** menu.

From here, you can monitor the status of your pipeline.

## Analysis Results

Once the analysis pipeline is finished, you can view the analysis results in your browser or download the files to your machine.

![results.png][]

These results include the MLST profile as generated by [mentalist][]. 

## Metadata Table

If you selected the **Save Results to Project Line List Metadata** option when launching the pipeline, the MLST scheme and sequence type will be integrated into the IRIDA Line List/Metadata table as shown below.

# Building

## Installing IRIDA Libraries

To build this plugin yourself, you must first install [IRIDA][] to your local Maven repository. Please make sure you are installing the IRIDA version defined in the `irida.version.compiletime` property in the [pom.xml][] file (e.g., `19.01.3`). Or, alternatively, please update the IRIDA dependency version in the `pom.xml` file.

To install the IRIDA libraries to a local Maven repository, please run the following from within the [IRIDA][] project (the `irida/` directory):

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

## Building MentaLiST Plugin

Once IRIDA is installed, you may build the pipeline plugin by running the following in this project's directory (the `irida-plugin-mentalist/` directory):

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This should produce a `target/*.jar` file, which can be copied into `/etc/irida/plugins/`.
